this is just an assembler
we need a seq file  
and maybe a library file
based on the a5 pipeline

/bin no longer needed

take all the scaffolds, and map to the NR database using blast.

This adapter.fasta file is needed to run the pipeline.

If we don't have a lib file, we just need forward and reverse reads
else run with the lib file (the lib file just tells you the fwd and rev, also gives distance).

There still seems to be stuff getting called from the s3 bucket, some called from the AMI. To standardize and made consistent.
